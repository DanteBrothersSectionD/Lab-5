Design/Development process:

Overall Theme-
The overall theme I was going for was a very colourful and pleasing music which would look very nice but also be easy to navigate.

Colour Scheme-
For the colour scheme I used https://coolors.co which is a website that helps you pick out colours that match eachother (perfect for website making). I landed on some warm colours like pink and light purple
as it fit the vibe I was trying to go for.

Cards-
I actually loved the cards because they felt simple enough to code and control, but also they look wayyyyyy better and cleaner than what weve been doing with flexboxes (major improvements visually from this
point on).

Buttons-
Buttons were simple enough as the code to link them to other pages looked something like this:
    <div class="content">
        <a href="Genres.html">
            <button class="action-button">Explore</button>
        </a>
    </div>
aswell as the styling which included hover effects and general looks on the buttons.

Transitions-
Transitions took me a little bit to get used to but once I understood them I saw the massive potential they can have on making a good looking website with clean transitions.

Nav Bar-
The nav bar was taken from my assignemt 1 website and it has a cool effect where it makes a box over the word your hovering over and it also changes the text colour. Also this is where I put the website logo
which if clicked, brings you back to the home page. this was achieved with this simple line of code:
          <a href="Home.html">
            <h1 class="tit"><img class="logo" src="logo.png" height="50">Music Lab</h1>
        </a>

Footer-
Footer was simple enough and is definetly the most bare bones thing on my website.

Card Info-
Had to do alot of reasearch for this section because even though I listen to alot of music, I still couldnt give exact definitions for things like genres or instruments used in the songs I liked. The easiest
part was when I got to talk about my favourite artists as that's just my own opinion as to why i like them.

Video Background-
This was a struggle to figure out and in the end the problem was I used a youtube video link instead of downloading the video and linking that lol. Besides that setback video backgrounds are the COOLEST THING
weve done so far in my opinion because they make sites look SO GOOD. The HTML code for it looks like this:
    <div class="background-video">
        <video autoplay muted loop id="background-video">
            <source src="Pink Smoke Free Background Videos, Motion Graphics, No Copyright _ All Background Videos.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
    </div>

Logo-
the logo was fun to make as I took 2 different images and spliced them toghether to make it. The logo is a beaker with music notes inside of it (hence the name "Music Lab").

Images-
Lastly all the images I got were either from google or soundcloud!

P.S. Sorry I submitted this so late, I honestly had such a mental roadblock where I had no motivation to do anything. This is defenitly the last time I'll sumbit something this late, guess I was just having a 
bad week.
